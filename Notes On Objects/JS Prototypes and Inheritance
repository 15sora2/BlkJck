****Getting started w/ JS prototypes****
    var arr = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
    var last = arr[arr.length-1];
    var last = arr[arr.length-1];
    display(last)

***What is a prototype?***
-->A function that exists on every object in JS
-->A prototype is an object, not a class
-->functions and objects have prototypes

var fluffy = new Cat('fluffy', 'white');
Cat.prototype.age = 3;
display(Cat.prototype) //prototype of an object instance
display(fluffy._proto_)
    -->These two point to the same instance of Cat

-->A function's prototype:
    -->The object instance that will become the prototype for all objects created
        using this function as a constructor
-->An object's prototype:
    --> An object's prototype is the object instance from which the object is inherited
