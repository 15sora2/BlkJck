<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    -->rel: specifies the relationship between this
        html/browser and the link

***CSS Levels***
***Rules***
body{
    background-color:#ccc99;
}
-->body: Selector
-->background-color:#ccc99: propertyname:value;
    -->Uses property name, not Id

***Simple Selectors***
-->body: simple selector
-->A selector is a pattern used to apply styles to elements
-->#id: selector finds the element with the given Id
-->.bookTitle: selectot that finds the element of the given class
-->use classes to apply style to multiple elements.
--> use id's to apply style to individual elements

***Other Selectors***
-->Descendant selector
div p{
    //...
}
    -->The style will be applied to any <p> withing the <div>

-->Child Selector
div > p{
    //...
}
    -->Looks for the <p> that is directly under the <div>

-->Attribute selector
img[alt=spacer]{
    padding:0px;
}
    -->Applies the style to any image with the alt=spacer

-->Psuedo class
    a:visited{color:...}
        -->Applies the style to <a> if the link has been visited
        -->Styles based on conditions of the inherited class (which is written first in this case, the <a>)

-->/*...*/: CSS commenting

****Specifying Property Values***
-->Screen measurements: pixels(px)
-->Physical measurements: inches(in), points(pt)

****Cascading & Inheritance****
***The Cascade***
--> Order of importance 
    ->Author stylesheet -> User stylesheet -> Default stylesheet
-->User Stylesheet: formatting and style provided by the browser
    -->There are websites that will tell you the browser's default style of
        elements on the page
--> Author Stylesheet: Stylesheet created by you, the developer
--> !important keyword puts forst priority on the given style, ignoreing the level of importance 
    of the types of CSS

***Ordering Rules***
-->Can link multiple CSS files in an html
-->The last style rule wins. That will be the style of the element
-->Can import styles from one CSS into another
    -->(At the top of a CSS file)
            @import url("stylesheetName.css");
    -->Can override those styles by adding styles into the 
        current CSS file

****Developer tools and CSS****
-->Developer tools in the browser can show what's going on
    with elements in the page
    -->Can show what style rules were overrided

****CSS Reset****
-->Compatability view that can be found in Internet Explorer
    -->Converts the current User Stylesheet to an older version
-->Can find a CSS Reset file online somewhere

****Specificity****
-->The more specific the rule is when pointing to an element, the
    higher the rating (it wins in styling the element)
-->Specificity applies to rules that are pointing to the same element.
    If one is changing the font but others arent then the font will be changed
        with no issue.

****Inheritance****
